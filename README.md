# 🚗 Driving Theory Notes (Germany)

## 📘 About

I created this repo to collect my personal notes while preparing for the German driving theory exam.  
Originally, I found a helpful GitHub repository where someone had shared their own study material.  
That inspired me to do the same — not only to keep everything in one place for myself, but also to help others who might be looking for shortcuts, summaries, or quick reference material.

These notes cover various topics like:

- Road signs and driving rules  
- Safety checks  
- Legal requirements  
- Braking and reaction distance formulas  
- Theory test tips  
- And more...

## 💡 Why This Exists

- To help me and others prepare smarter for the theory exam  
- To offer an easy-to-skim summary of important rules  
- To keep a handy reference I can revisit or share anytime  
- To contribute something small back to the driving learner community

## 🛠️ Usage

- Browse or search the Markdown file for topics  
- Use it on your phone or print a copy for offline study  
- Share it with friends also preparing for the exam
